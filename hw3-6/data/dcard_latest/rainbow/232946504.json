{"id":232946504,"title":"Where the Heart Is - 8","content":"Alexia was crouching down in front of her mother's grave, with Chris and Mia beside. Today is her mother's birthday, and the girl looks grimmer than any other person. She wasn't happy, or sad — she has been numb — she silently stayed there, staring, with a heavy heart. She was tired, and separated. \n\n'Hey mom, we're here.' she smiled, lightly placed her fingers on her mother's cold gravestone. \n\n'Mom, I'm back...' softly said by Chris. \n\nBoth Alexia and Chris silenced. Seemed like they could still hear their mother, feel her existence beside. Tears escaped from their eyes. \n\n\n\n(flashback)\n'aaaaaaah' \n\nhigh pitch of loud screaming stormed out upstairs. 'It was Alexia's voice' Chris panicked. \n\nAlexia kept on screaming, she soon then lost her voices. She was shocked, sad, scared, and lost, the second she entered her mother's room. Bloods everywhere, covered the whole sheets and her mom. She couldn't find her voice to talk, to scream, or to cry. \n\n'Alex?' Chris rushed into the room breathlessly. \n\n'M-mom?'\n\n\n\nChris lightly squeezed, Mia's hand was in his. He remembered the warmth of her mother's smiles and the softness between his mother's voices, every time he returned home from another city, her mother came out of the kitchen with a simple glass of water, said, 'how are you son?' 'I'm doing good mom, I've missed you.' Chris said. And seemed like he could hear her mother smiled, 'I've missed you too.'\n\n'Mom, this is Mia. She's my girlfriend. I've decided to move back, with Mia. Mom, don't worry, I'll take care of her and Alexia.'\n\n'Yea mom, I know what you are thinking about. Mia is nice. I'm sure you'll like her too.' Alexia smiled. 'I've missed you too...' she whispered 'I see you every night in my dreams.'\n\n'I'm sorry I wasn't able to save me... to save you...'\n\nMia reached to Chris shoulder, softly whispered 'let's just stay here for a while mmh?' with her hand lightly rubbing his back. Chris took a deep breath, staring at his sister's back 'I never know this impacted Lexi this much... I know it hurt her. She is always so strong you know? Like... she's being very sensitive and protective of herself ever since the day mom died. Her emotions, feelings... sometimes even if I'm her brother, it's really hard to tell, or see how she really is. If this was going to be anyone's fault... it would be mine too...' he stared down to the ground, 'It was me, leaving her alone to face these pain her own. I wasn't always there for her when I was out for all those damn work, to be able to make more money for both of us. Damn... I just...'\n\n'Hey babe, it's none of your fault. I'm sure Alex wouldn't think so too, not even to think that she would ever blame you. She appreciates all of your hard work, and we all knew that. If it wasn't you, we can't even tell how's her life will be now, hmm?' Chris nodded. His heart broke, when he saw his sister Alexia hurting. \n\nIt was a light breeze slipped beneath Alexia's reddened eyes, blew away her tears, as if her mother caressing her cheeks, wiped her tears off her face. As the young girl blinked away her tears, suns glows warmer, than ever. She couldn't outrun the pain, yet it's time to collect herself together again. \n\nAlexia couldn't bear to eat anything after the visit to her mother. Chris figured, however he decided to leave his sister some time herself. He knows his sister well, but there's no place for him to help her. The girl always keeps things locked too well. Even if there was a moment her walls melted, the next second the distance would hold up again. \n\n'Hey babe.' Mia spoke with a soft tone, with a glass of water in her hand. Slowly placed it in front of the man, as she sat down beside, close enough to snuggle her head onto his shoulder, wrapped her arms around her boyfriend's. Chris took the glass, wearing a sad smile 'Thanks...' as he took a small sip. \n\n'You wanna... talk?' the lady worryingly stared at the man, watching every small movement the man had, the wrinkles between his brows, each of his breath in the gloominess. \n\n'What happened on that day?' with a whisper, Mia wasn't sure if it was her place to asked. 'I understand if you don't want to answer it... but I'm worried.' \n\nThe man didn't answer, instead, he left out a long, deep exhale.\n\nHe took another sip from the glass. Inhaled. \n\n'The day... we went home from school. Alexia was wearing that biggest, warmest, sweetest smile on her face. I hadn't seen her smile like the day for a long while back then.' Chris smiled, with a few tears dropped onto his laps. 'She hopped upstairs, excitedly, not even bothered still having those shoes on.' he continued ‘she couldn’t wait to show mom her drawing. She had that, amused twinkles in her eyes.’\n\n‘What happened then?’\n\n‘After a while, she screamed.’ Chris lifted his head up, as the couple’s eye met each other’s, Mia could see the sorrow through those darkened eyes. ‘I rushed to the room, there was... blood everywhere. I couldn’t see my mom’s face so clear. Lexi screamed until she no longer found her sound and her strength to do so... and my father got arrested after a few days.’ he swallowed. ‘My father was an abusive alcoholic . When we were younger, he drank- and he drank, not without a day. We would peek through the crack under the door. Shadows of them - parents fighting, shattered glass on the floor, broken dirty dishes... we locked ourselves behind the door and listening to the loud bang on the other side. We could hear mom got knocked down on the floor... slapped, revilement... Lexi would cover up her mouth, forced herself to cry in silence becaus-’ the man swallowed, ‘ if she burst into tears, with any single noise...’\n\n‘He would do bad things to us...’\n\nThe man buried his face in both his hands, cried ‘I tried to run away from my home - which was no longer a home for me - leaving Alexia and mom alone - with him. I was... scared, and I could do nothing to help us. It was my fault Mia... it was my fault... she was so young, so young... I should have done something.’\n\n‘Shhh...’ Mia held the man’s head to her shoulder, ‘You know that’s not right. It’s not the blame for you to take, you know it Chris... you knew it. You took care of her in her darkest moments, you did everything you could to give what’s best you had. You were scared, she could see it. You loved her, I’m sure she knew it too.’\n\n‘You’ve never seen Lexi’s smile, the most beautiful, brightest, sweetest, warmest - as the mid-spring daylight - would blow all the bad moods away, melt your frost all the way down, and you smiled, and laughed, as she did.’\n\n‘I- wish I could see her smile again. The missing smile I had - Alexia once had it - eight years ago.’\n\n\n\n\n\n- - - -\n新年快樂～\n不知道各位的假期過得如何呀？☺️😆\nhttps://youtu.be/Otq-6a4wdzY\nOTR - Heart","excerpt":"Alexia was crouching down in front of her mother's grave， with Chris and Mia beside.
