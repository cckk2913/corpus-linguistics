They created this series of whiskies to satisfy those peaty lovers, or exactly, peaty addicts. Octomore claims the highest ppm of peaty of all whiskies available, making nicknamed ‘’peaty monster.’’ Bruichladdich distillery applied laboratory concepts to elevate peaty ppm to around 400 after caramelizing the malt. Though peaty ppm decreased to about 200 after two times of distillation, this incredible strong peaty level keeps those ordinary drinkers away from shelve. As a peaty lover I am, it’s absolutely to give this legendary whisky a try.\n.\n58.5% abv, ppm: 208, cask strength, natural color, non chill-filtered\n\nColor: pale gold, (the calm before the storm)\n.\nIn neat\nNosing: stinky odor of blue cheese, unexpectedly lovely\nPalating: extreme malty, mild peaty, medicinal flavour, iodine and other chemical impression\nAftertaste: extreme long, woody, sweet of Chinese medicine\n.\nWith a split of water\nNosing: melted parmason cheese, surprisingly no peaty nor smoky, \nPalating: bubbly, surprising fresh flowery, fresh fruity of kiwi, plum, \nAftertaste: extra long, acetone, organic solution, unpleasant flavour.\n.\nI have this whisky in a small bar called Bar Diary in Kaohsiung, which has a corporation with Drunken Master. They have plenty of whiskies at second floor, many of them were unavailable nowadays. One of their staff, Anson, toured me the second floor, where is a lovely place to appreciate whiskies as well as cigars. Hope someday I could have the change to be there again.\n為什麼\n一定要\n十五個\n中文字\n啦啦啦","excerpt":"Octomore （Ochdamh-mòr） is an experimental series from Bruichladdich distillery on Isle of Islay.
